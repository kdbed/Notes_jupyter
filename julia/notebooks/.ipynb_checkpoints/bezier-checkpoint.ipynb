    ">This post was inspired mostly by the arrival of the new Julia package [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) by Fredrik Ekre. Literate lets you write a Julia source file, a Markdown blog post, and a Jupyter notebook all at the same time. It's magic, or, at least, indistinguishable from magic... As a result, you might be able to find a Jupyter notebook version of this Markdown-converted Julia source file somewhere nearby (look in the [github repo](https://github.com/cormullion/cormullion.github.io) for this blog, perhaps). The code uses the following packages, Literate, Luxor, Colors, Roots, Fontconfig, DataFrames, Iterators, ColorSchemes, and should work in Julia v0.6 (some packages such as Colors have yet to be updated to work with version 0.7)."

The idea is that as `p1` divides `A` to `A1`, `p2` divides `A1` to `B1` and `p3` divides `B1` to `B`. So, `pp1` divides `p1` to `p2`, and `pp2` divides `p2` to `p3`. And you keep doing this until you can't divide any more, and eventually the point `P` plots the course of the final Bézier curve. The red and blue parts of the curve show that this technique is also a good way to split a single Bézier curve into two separate ones, and the red and blue parts are separate control polygons."

You can see this if you draw a *very* large circle and a *very* large matching Bézier segment. For a circle with radius 10 meters (and that's one big PDF), the discrepancy between the pure circle and the Bézier approximation isn't much bigger than the size of this period/full stop.←"

    "All the images in this post are in PNG, but they looked better in the vector-based SVG format. However, there's an annoying ‘bug’ in Jupyter/IJulia/IPython involving text in SVG images created by Cairo. What happens is that Cairo tries to be smart and stores text in XML symbols, suitable for re-use. A good idea, but unfortunately they're stored in the notebook's ‘global XML scope’, and so later cells accidentally pick up symbol definitions from earlier cells and re-use them, even though that's not always what you want. A solution would be to somehow encapsulate the SVG image in a cell to prevent the definitions leaking. I don't know how to do that yet, but there's an [open issue](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl/issues/662) if you can help me find a workround..."
